Level 05 – Misplaced Trust in Cookies
Vulnerability: Insecure access control via cookies
● A cookie named “blacklist” can unlock new functionality.
● Use the “-b” flag in curl to submit cookies.
● Look for any hardcoded logic in scripts.
● An altered cookie might allow you to retrieve hidden files.
● Investigate cookies to control access to stored data.

Here's the first page when accessing http://localhost:8000

<html>
  <head>
   <title>Secret Password Storage</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Store your secret passwords</h1>
    <p>Use this handy web applications to store all the passwords you use on the Internet!</p>
    <p>Even for supersecure sites like www.bank.com!</p>
    <form method="post" name="store" action="/cgi-bin/store">
      <p>ID: <input type="text" name="id" /></p>
      <p>Site: <input type="text" name="site" /></p>
      <p>Username: <input type="text" name="username" /></p>
      <p>Password: <input type="password" name="password" /></p>
      <p><input type="submit" value="Submit your password" /></p>
      <input type="hidden" name="admin" value="0"/>
    </form>  
    <h1>Retrieve your secret passwords</h1>
    <form method="post" name="retrieve" action="/cgi-bin/retrieve">
      <p>ID: <input type="text" name="id" /></p>
      <p>Site: <input type="text" name="site" /></p>
      <p><input type="submit" value="Retrieve your password" /></p>
      <input type="hidden" name="admin" value="0"/>
    </form>  
   </body>
 </html>


When I saved a password I entered:
ID: admin
Sit: www.bank.com (because it's a hint from the first page)
Username: test
Password: test

So in /cgi-bin/store 's page:
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Password Storage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
<p>Password saved.</p>
  </body>
</html>

Then back in the first page I entered for retrieveal:
ID: admin
Site: www.bank.com

So in /cgi-bin/retrieve 's page:
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Password Retrieval</title>
  </head>
  <body>
<pre>www.bank.com:test:test
</pre>
  </body>
</html>


I have noticed though in the first page there is this line:
<input type="hidden" name="admin" value="0"/>

I changed the value to 1:
<input type="hidden" name="admin" value="1"/>

Then I get a page that says "No cookies exist"
So I added a cookie with the name "blacklist" as the hints stated but with no value.
Then I went back to page 1 with ID being admin, Site being www.bank.com, with the value still being 1 <input type="hidden" name="admin" value="1"/>, added a cookie called blacklist and then got a page that printed "Non-existent cookie entries: site"
So then I added a cookie with the name "site" with no value.
Then I went back to page 1 with ID being admin, Site being www.bank.com, with the value still being 1 <input type="hidden" name="admin" value="1"/>, a cookie called blacklist, added a cookie called site, and then got a page that printed "Non existent cookie entreies: password"
So then I added a cookie with the name "password" with no value
Then I went back to page 1 with ID being admin, Site being www.bank.com, with the value still being 1 <input type="hidden" name="admin" value="1"/>, a cookie called blacklist, a cookie called site, and then got a page that printed "Wrong password."

I got a hint saying that I need to name blacklist to either "store" or retrieve

So setting black list to store like the following
blacklist	"store"
id	"admin"
password	"test"
site	"www.bank.com"
username	"test"

I hit the admin page for store:
Blacklist:

#!/usr/bin/python3

#debugging
#import cgitb; cgitb.enable()

def die(s):
    print("Content-Type: text/html")
    print("")
    print("""

""" % s)
    sys.exit(0)


form = cgi.FieldStorage()

if "id" in form:
    id = form["id"].value;
else:
    id = ""
if "site" in form:
    site = form["site"].value;
else:
    site = ""
if "username" in form:
    username = form["username"].value;
else:
    username = ""
if "password" in form:
    password = form["password"].value;
else:
    password = ""
if "admin" in form:
    admin = form["admin"].value;
else:
    admin = "0"

debug = False
if debug:
    id = "foo1337"
    site = "www.bar.com"
    username = "john"
    password = "pazzword"
    admin = "1"

if (id == "" or site == "" or username == "" or password == ""):
    die("

Missing parameters.
")

if not id.isalnum():
    die("

Bad id.
")

if admin == "1":
    try:
        blacklist = cookies.SimpleCookie(os.environ['HTTP_COOKIE'])['blacklist'].value
    except Exception:
        die("

Malformed cookie or missing blacklist name
")
    if blacklist.isalnum() == False:
        die("

Bad blacklist name. It must be alphanumeric.
")
    try:
        f = open(blacklist, "r")
        m = f.read()
        f.close()
    except Exception as ex:
        die("

Cannot open blacklist file %s: %s
" % (blacklist, str(e)))

    die("

Blacklist:

%s

" % m)

try:
    f = open("/challenge/storage/" + id, "a+")
    f.write("%s:%s:%s\n" % (site, username, password))
    f.close()
except Exception as ex:
    die("

Something went horriby wrong (%s). Contact the admin.
" % str(e))

die("

Password saved.
")





But I did the same for the retrieval by setting blacklist to "retrieve" but still got "Wrong Password." blacklist needs to be a file path
